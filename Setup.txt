Get and build pythonnet from https://github.com/pythonnet/pythonnet.git
Copy newly built pythonnet runtime files to a new folder you create - such as c:\pythonnet
    -app.manifest
    -clr.pyd
    -nPython.exe
    -Python.Runtime.dll
    
Add this new folder to your path environment variable

Get the files from the repo into a new folder (We'll call this the source folder)

Copy the following FlexLib dlls to this new source folder
    -Flex.UiWpfFramework.dll
    -FlexLib.dll
    -Util.dll
    -Vita.dll

Connect your Flex 6000 to your network and turn it on.
    
Open a command prompt and issue this command to start the python example code:

    npython Example.py
    
    A text window should open and start displaying data data.
    
 Close the text window to stop the pytyon example.
